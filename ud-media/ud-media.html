    <h1>Some Movies</h1>
    <p>I really enjoy <strong>Playing Football</strong>. One of the things I like to do in my spare time is Watch Movies at <a href="https://www.cinemark.com/theatres/co-boulder/cinemark-century-boulder" title="Century Theater">Cinemark Century Boulder</a>. My favorite movie so far this year is <a href="https://www.badboys.movie/">Bad Boys, Ride or Die</a>.</p>
